  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>
     Illustrations are a visually and emotionally powerful tool. So use them sparingly and carefully identify the right situations for them. If an illustration is used only as a decorative element, it may lose its communicative power and distract people. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Use illustration to encourage users who are frustrated, are lost, or have had something go wrong. Don't use illustration if the user is in danger.
