    <h2 class="mt0">Adaptable</h2>
    <p>
      Firefox products should adapt themselves to anyone, from new users (simple controls, help/encouragement in using features) to seasoned Mozillians (customization/control of the entire browser experience).

    <h2 class="mt0">Aware</h2>
    <p>
      Firefox products are vigilant on behalf of users, providing tools to keep them safe while helping them browse better. Firefox products are also perceptive, and look for signals from users before deciding how to act.

    <h2 class="mt0">Supportive</h2>
    <p>
      Firefox products understand user needs and desires, supporting them with relevant experiences. Firefox products should be helpful in both proactive and passive ways.
